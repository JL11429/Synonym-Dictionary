<h1>Synonym Dictionary</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The objective of the program is to suggest synonyms for words in a given input text. The program processes a file containing a synonym dictionary structured as groups of related words, reflecting different meanings based on context (e.g., “run” as “sprint” or “manage”). It identifies each word's root form and inflections. It implements the dictionary in a binary search tree for efficient access, with nodes containing root words, inflections, synonym group indices, and height for AVL balancing. Additionally, synonym groups are stored as lists of node pointers. The structure ensures flexibility and precision in synonym replacement. The following key features are developped: parsing the input text and matching words with radicals in an AVL tree structure, suggesting synonyms from grouped root words for user selection, allowing users to choose appropriate inflections of selected synonyms.
